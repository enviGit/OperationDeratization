Thank you for downloading the Altar Ruins Free Pack!

The pack contains a selection of low poly models which you can use in your projects. There are three variations: with the meshes already grouped, in case you quickly want to place some objects around your scene, separated meshes; all meshes are split up into individual parts so you can use them as you see fit, and separated meshes without the bottom faces, in case you need to save resources for other things.

Other specifications:

Poly count: 6,010.
Textures: Albedo, Specular, Normal, Occlusion at 4096x4096 pixels each.
