Thank you for using "Low Poly Post-Apocalyptic Buildings"!


Adding Objects To Your Scene:

To add the buildings to your scene drag and drop the models from either the "Fbx" or "Prefab" folders into your "Hierarchy" in the Unity editor. 


Also to add the girders and stairs to your buildings, drag and drop them from the "Prefabs" or "Fbx" folders and then center them so that they are inside the buildings.

Please note: Buldings, girders, and stairs are paired individually of each other and are based on their asssigned names. 
I.e Building_1_Interior must be paird with Stairs_1_Interior, etc.
