# Operation Deratization

Operation Deratization is a first-person shooter game set in a Battle Royale arena with a unique twist. In this game, players take on the role of an undercover agent/soldier/commando tasked with ensuring that none of the prisoners participating in the game survives to gain their freedom. The prisoners are likened to rats fighting for their lives, and the player's mission is to "exterminate" them.

The game features simple and intuitive controls, including WASD movement and mouse aiming. Players can loot items and equipment, and there are eight characters available to play, including seven AI opponents. The game is set in a 3D low-poly environment with one map featuring various spawn points and locations. The game also includes health bars, and players can activate trackers to confirm the death of their opponents.
