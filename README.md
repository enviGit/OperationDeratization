# Operation Deratization

Operation Deratization is a first-person shooter game set in a Battle Royale arena with a unique twist. In this game, players take on the role of an undercover agent tasked with ensuring that none of the prisoners participating in the game survives to gain their freedom. The prisoners are likened to rats fighting for their lives, and the player's mission is to "exterminate" them.

The game features simple and intuitive controls, including WASD movement and mouse aiming. Players can loot items and equipment. The game is set in a 3D environment with one map featuring various spawn points and locations. The player can activate a tracker that will briefly point them to the nearest opponent who hasn't been marked and by getting close enough to a dead opponent's body, they can mark them using a chip.
